# Local queue files

- Put every user-created task queue and sequential queue plan in `queues/` at the repository root.
- `queues/` is intentionally ignored by Git. Do not stage, commit, move, or delete its contents unless the user explicitly asks.
- Keep reusable, versioned examples outside `queues/` (for example, `tasks.example.yaml` and `queues.plan.example.yaml`).
